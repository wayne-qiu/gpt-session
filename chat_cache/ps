Here's an example:\n\nNew-Alias -Name myalias -Value \"C:\\path\\to\\command.exe -param1 value1 -param2 value2\"\n\nReplace \"myalias\" with the name you want to give to your alias, and \"C:\\path\\to\\command.exe -param1 value1 -param2 value2\" with the actual command and parameters you want to run. Once you've created the alias, you can use it just like any other PowerShell command."

Now, whenever you type \"l\" in PowerShell, it will run the `Get-ChildItem` command with those fixed parameters."
