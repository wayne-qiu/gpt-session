When you run `git show` followed by a commit hash, it will display the commit information and the changes made in that commit, including the file names, lines added, and lines removed.\n\n`git diff`, on the other hand, is used to compare two sets of changes, such as the changes between two commits or two branches. When you run `git diff` followed by the commit hashes or branch names, it will display the differences between the two sets of changes, including the file names, lines added, and lines removed.\n\nIn summary, `git show` is used to view information about a specific commit, while `git diff` is used to compare changes between two sets of commits or branches."
