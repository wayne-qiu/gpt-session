The getopts command is used to parse short options, which are usually a single letter preceded by a hyphen (-). The getopt function can parse both short and long options, which are usually words preceded by two hyphens (--). \n\nTo use getopts, you need to define the options you want to parse and their corresponding actions. The syntax is as follows:\n\n```\nwhile getopts \":a:b:c:\" opt; do\n  case $opt in\n    a) var_a=\"$OPTARG\";;\n    b) var_b=\"$OPTARG\";;\n    c) var_c=\"$OPTARG\";;\n    \\?) echo \"Invalid option: -$OPTARG\" >&2;;\n  esac\ndone\n```\n\nIn this example, the options -a, -b, and -c are defined, and their corresponding variables var_a, var_b, and var_c are assigned the values of their parameters. The colon after each option letter indicates that the option requires a parameter. The backslash before the question mark in the esac statement is used to handle invalid options.\n\nTo use getopt, you need to define the options you want to parse and their corresponding actions, similar to getopts.
